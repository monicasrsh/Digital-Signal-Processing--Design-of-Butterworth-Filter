# Digital-Signal-Processing--Design-of-Butterworth-Filter
## AIM:
To design of 2nd order Low Pass Butterworth Filter using using Bilinear Transformation.

## Software Required: 
MAT LAB R2012

## ALGORITHM: 
Step 1: Open MAT LAB. Write the program. 

Step 2: Read the values of Ap,As,Pass band frequency,Stop band frequency.

Step 3: Initialise some conditions find out the order (N) value.

Step 4: Find out the transfer function of the filter and magnitude of that filter. 

Step 5: Plot the magnitude spectrum with x-label and y-label with suitable title. 

Step 6: Terminate the program.
